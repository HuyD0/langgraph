# The Daily Drill page

The learning-path page published at https://claude.ai/artifact/G7841w2YuwNwEGjwEWiDMg:
69 lessons in 14 modules (AI & ML foundations through agents, security, reliability,
shipping and the Azure Databricks platform), each lesson going Learn, Check, Build,
Interview. The same page is what `drill-server` serves on your Mac ([SERVER.md](SERVER.md)).

The page is one self-contained HTML file. Python exercises run in the browser with
[Skulpt](https://skulpt.org). On claude.ai, hints, reviews and the study list use the
artifact's `sample` and `db` capabilities; served locally they talk to `/api/*` instead.
The switch is `claudeBackend()` / `localBackend()` at the bottom of `page.html`.

## Where things are

Everything is in the package, under `src/drill/content/`:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `modules/<module>.py` | One file per chapter, lessons in the order they appear: `foundations.py`, `rag.py`, `agents.py`... |
| `modules/__init__.py` | `ORDER`, the order of the chapters, and `LIFECYCLE`, the strip at the top of the page |
| `model.py` | The helpers a lesson is written with: `lesson`, `exercise`, `case`, `question`, `angle`, `stack` |
| `classics.py` | The Learn panel for the 9 classic interview problems. The problems themselves are `drill.problems`, the same bank `drill start` drills |
| `extras.py` | The glossary, the good-habits rules and the gotchas lists |
| `page.html` | The page: layout, styles and all the JavaScript. `/*DATA*/` is replaced with the content at build time |
| `build.py` | Puts it together: `build_data()` is the content as one dict, `render_page()` embeds it |

The money & health track comes from `drill.mine` (`drill.mine.export`), with made-up data.

## Build and publish

```bash
uv run drill build-page           # checks every exercise, then writes dist/daily-drill.html and dist/data.json
uv run pytest tests/test_content.py
```

The build refuses to finish if Big-O notation (`O(n)` and friends) appears in anything the
learner reads: the wording is plain language throughout ("walks through the list once").

To also check the exercises in Skulpt, which supports less Python than CPython:

```bash
cd scripts/skulpt-check && npm install && node check_in_browser_python.js
```

Then ask Claude Code to publish `dist/daily-drill.html` to the URL above. Publishing to the
same URL keeps learners' progress, which lives in the artifact's database, not in the HTML.

## Adding a lesson

Open the module's file in `src/drill/content/modules/` and add a `lesson(MODULE, ...)` call
where it should appear. Copy a neighbour; every field is named. In short:

- `title` and `learn`: the heading and the paragraphs to read (backticks for code,
  `**bold**` for a term).
- `example`: a caption and a few lines showing the idea.
- `check`: a multiple-choice `question(...)`, with `answer` as the index of the right option
  and `why` shown after answering.
- `angle`: the interview angle: the `pattern` name, the plain-language `text`, a sentence
  to `say` out loud, and optionally the `classic` interview problem that uses the same idea.
- `stack`: optional, the same idea in Databricks, LangGraph, LangChain or MLflow.
- `exercise`: the `prompt`, `starter`, `solution` and `cases` (mark one `sample=True`), the
  `guided` scaffold with `___` blanks and the matching `fills`, and the Learn panel
  (`concepts`, `byhand`, `why`, `gotchas`).

Then `uv run drill build-page`. It runs the solution and the filled-in scaffold against the
cases, so a lesson that cannot be solved never reaches the page. A new chapter is a new
file with its own `MODULE = module(...)`, plus its id in `ORDER` and in one `LIFECYCLE` stage.

Keep the wording plain and the page quiet: no Big-O, and visuals only where they replace
text.
