# The Daily Drill page

The learning-path page published at https://claude.ai/artifact/G7841w2YuwNwEGjwEWiDMg:
119 lessons in 16 modules (AI & ML foundations through agents and agent teams, security,
pricing and sizing, reliability, shipping and the Azure Databricks platform), each lesson
going Learn, Check, Build, Explain. The same page is what `drill-server` serves on your Mac ([SERVER.md](SERVER.md)).

The page is one self-contained HTML file. Python exercises run in the browser with
[Skulpt](https://skulpt.org). On claude.ai, hints, reviews and the study list use the
artifact's `sample` and `db` capabilities; served locally they talk to `/api/*` instead.
The switch is `claudeBackend()` / `localBackend()` at the bottom of `page.html`.

## Where things are

Everything is in the package, under `src/drill/content/`:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `modules/<module>.py` | One file per chapter, lessons in the order they appear: `foundations.py`, `rag.py`, `agents.py`... |
| `modules/__init__.py` | `ORDER`, the order of the chapters, and `LIFECYCLE`, the strip at the top of the page |
| `model.py` | The helpers a lesson is written with: `lesson`, `exercise`, `case`, `question`, `angle`, `stack` |
| `classics.py` | The Learn panel for the 9 classic interview problems. The problems themselves are `drill.problems`, the same bank `drill start` drills |
| `extras.py` | The glossary, and the gotcha cards: each names the lesson whose Explain step shows it as a "Spot the gotcha" challenge, or the Build-step moment a working habit appears |
| `page.html` | The page: layout, styles and all the JavaScript. `/*DATA*/` is replaced with the content at build time |
| `build.py` | Puts it together: `build_data()` is the content as one dict, `render_page()` embeds it |

The money & health track comes from `drill.mine` (`drill.mine.export`), with made-up data.

## The study list

Select any text in a lesson, or a line of your code, to save it to the study list in the
Notebook. Each item shows as one line until you open it, grouped by the lesson it came from in
path order, under three headings:

- **Review now**: items you marked "Got it" whose review has come round. Try to recall it, check
  what you saved, then say whether you remembered. Remembering pushes the next review further
  out (3 days, then 10, 30 and 90); forgetting puts it back on To learn.
- **To learn**: everything still being learned, with its explanation, quiz and follow-ups inside.
- **Got it**: closed by default, each with its next review date.

The search box looks through the text, your notes, the explanations and the lesson names.

**Two copies.** On claude.ai the list lives in the artifact's database; served by `drill-server`
it lives in `.drill/drill.db`. The two cannot reach each other, so they don't sync by themselves.
Both keep items by id with a last-changed time, so they merge safely, as often as you like:

```bash
uv run drill study export study.json     # this Mac's list
uv run drill study import study.json     # merge a list in: new items added, the newer copy of an item wins
```

For the claude.ai side, ask Claude Code to "sync my study lists": it reads the artifact's
`study` collection, imports it here, and writes back anything newer from this Mac. Removing an
item is not remembered, so remove it from both copies. The merge rules are in
`src/drill/server/study.py`.

## Build and publish

```bash
uv run drill build-page           # checks every exercise, then writes dist/daily-drill.html and dist/data.json
uv run pytest tests/test_content.py
```

The build refuses to finish if Big-O notation (`O(n)` and friends) appears in anything the
learner reads: the wording is plain language throughout ("walks through the list once").

To also check the exercises in Skulpt, which supports less Python than CPython:

```bash
cd scripts/skulpt-check && npm install && node check_in_browser_python.js
```

Then ask Claude Code to publish `dist/daily-drill.html` to the URL above. Publishing to the
same URL keeps learners' progress, which lives in the artifact's database, not in the HTML.

## Adding a lesson

Open the module's file in `src/drill/content/modules/` and add a `lesson(MODULE, ...)` call
where it should appear. Copy a neighbour; every field is named. In short:

- `title` and `learn`: the heading and the paragraphs to read (backticks for code,
  `**bold**` for a term).
- `example`: a caption and a few lines showing the idea.
- `check`: a multiple-choice `question(...)`, with `answer` as the index of the right option
  and `why` shown after answering.
- `angle`: the interview angle: the `pattern` name, the plain-language `text`, a sentence
  to `say` out loud, and optionally the `classic` interview problem that uses the same idea.
- `stack`: optional, the same idea in Databricks, LangGraph, LangChain or MLflow.
- `exercise`: the `prompt`, `starter`, `solution` and `cases` (mark one `sample=True`), the
  `guided` scaffold with `___` blanks and the matching `fills`, and the Learn panel
  (`concepts`, `byhand`, `why`, `gotchas`).

Then `uv run drill build-page`. It runs the solution and the filled-in scaffold against the
cases, so a lesson that cannot be solved never reaches the page. A new chapter is a new
file with its own `MODULE = module(...)`, plus its id in `ORDER` and in one `LIFECYCLE` stage.
A hyphen in the id becomes an underscore in the file name: `agent-teams` lives in
`agent_teams.py`.

Keep the wording plain and the page quiet: no Big-O, and visuals only where they replace
text.
